# Exploring Data Science
This repo will hold some projects regarding data visualization with science data sets and case studies


# Law Of Large Numbers
Proved the Law of Large Numbers with normal distribuations of the rand() function. 

Tested the normal distribution theory, checking the probability of numbers landing from -1 to 1 (68.2%). 
By using the Law of Large Numbers, it proved that the bigger the sample size and the closer you get to your expected value.


# Financial Statements
I have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly 
expenses for the financial year. I must calculate the following 
financial metrics:

- profit for each month
- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
